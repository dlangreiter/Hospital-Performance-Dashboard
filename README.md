Skills: SQL, Tableau, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)

1. Data Analysis: Hospital Performance Dashboard
Objective: Develop a dashboard to visualize hospital performance metrics to improve decision-making for hospital management.

Tools and Frameworks:

Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Data Visualization: Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Database Management: SQL, PostgreSQL
Web Framework: Flask, Dash (for web-based dashboards)
Plan:

Define Metrics and Objectives:

Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) for hospital performance (e.g., patient wait times, bed occupancy rates, readmission rates).
Data Collection and Integration:

Data Sources: Electronic Health Records (EHRs), hospital management systems, external datasets (e.g., public health databases).
Database Setup: Use PostgreSQL to store and manage data.
ETL Process: Extract data from sources, transform it to the required format, and load it into the database using Python (Pandas).
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies using Pandas.
Normalize and aggregate data for relevant metrics.
Data Analysis:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas and Seaborn to understand trends and distributions.
Use SQL queries to retrieve specific insights.
Dashboard Development:

Prototype: Create initial visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Interactive Dashboard: Develop an interactive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI for comprehensive visualizations.
Web-based Dashboard: Optionally, create a web-based dashboard using Flask or Dash for real-time updates and accessibility.
Testing and Validation:

Validate data accuracy and dashboard functionality with end-users.
Incorporate feedback and make necessary adjustments.
Deployment and Maintenance:

Deploy the dashboard on a server for access by hospital management.
Set up regular data updates and maintenance routines.
Documentation and Training:

Document the process, code, and usage instructions.
Provide training sessions for users to maximize dashboard utility.
